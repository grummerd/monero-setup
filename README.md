Here is how to setup Monero, both client and server. For local network use and for using the wallet via an external network.

The hole point is to be mobile. For that we need rpc working

What this tutorial doesn't do
-------------------------------

- run torsocks

- communicate thru an ssh tunnel or ssh proxy

- hide that you are running a monero server and wallet

- configure server security

What it does do
----------------

- Raise the `utility value` of monero by having the setup instructions in one place: not requiring linux/monero/router expertise, or endless web searches piecing support answers together from forums like stackexchange or reddit 

- Gives world+dog a chance at using monero properly instead of just being speculators and buying monero like toilet paper is going out of fashion.
