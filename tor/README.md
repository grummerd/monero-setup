monerod Tor setup
-------------------

**This is a work in progress**

Advantages
-------------

- The advantage of tor over rpc is wallets can connect to server from anywhere. Both on the same network as the server and remote connections

- tor onions are not linked to ip address. Home networks IP addresses may change. Murphys law. It'll happen. We want to be remote, so need to severe the chains of being tied down to an IP address

Once (korvi) i2p support comes out, use that, not tor. In the meantime, lets piece together how to configure monerod server and cli wallet thru tor
